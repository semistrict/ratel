// setCorruptRaftMuLocked is a stand-in for proper handling of failing replicas.
// Such a failure is indicated by a call to setCorruptRaftMuLocked with a
// ReplicaCorruptionError. Currently any error is passed through, but
// prospectively it should stop the range from participating in progress,
// trigger a rebalance operation and decide on an error-by-error basis whether
// the corruption is limited to the range, store, node or cluster with
// corresponding actions taken.
//
// Despite the fatal log call below this message we still return for the
// sake of testing.
//
// TODO(d4l3k): when marking a Replica corrupt, must subtract its stats from
// r.store.metrics. Errors which happen between committing a batch and sending
// a stats delta from the store are going to be particularly tricky and the
// best bet is to not have any of those.
// @bdarnell remarks: Corruption errors should be rare so we may want the store
// to just recompute its stats in the background when one occurs.
