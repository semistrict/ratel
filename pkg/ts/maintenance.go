// data. Currently, this includes computing rollups and pruning data which has
// exceeded its retention threshold, as well as computing low-resolution rollups
// of data. This system was designed specifically to be used by scanner queue
// from the storage package.
//
// The snapshot should be supplied by a local store, and is used only to
// discover the names of time series which are store in that snapshot. The KV
// client is then used to interact with data from the time series that are
// discovered; this may result in data being deleted, but may also write new
// data in the form of rollups.
//
// The snapshot is used for key discovery (as opposed to the KV client) because
// the task of pruning time series is distributed across the cluster to the
// individual ranges which contain that time series data. Because replicas of
// those ranges are guaranteed to have time series data locally, we can use the
// snapshot to quickly obtain a set of keys to be pruned with no network calls.
