	//   writes by the Go runtime have not been set up to
	//   redirect to a separate log file.
	// - it places a timestamp in front of the panic object,
	//   in case the various configuration options make
	//   the Go runtime solely responsible for printing
	//   out the panic object to the log file.
	//   (The go runtime doesn't time stamp its output.)
	//
	// Note that this code will cause the panic object to be printed
	// twice in some cases (specifically, when the panic is uncaught).
	// A previous version of this code was trying to prevent the
	// double print and was failing to do so effectively, causing
	// instead panics to be lost in the case where they were
	// recovered (eg via RecoverAndReportNonfatalPanic()).
	//
	// To properly prevent double prints, the API could be changed to
	// indicate whether the Go runtime will *eventually* print the panic
	// on its own. Unfortunately, this is a bit hard to do, as the
	// caller of ReportPanic() may not be in a position to know for
